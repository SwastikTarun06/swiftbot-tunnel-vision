SwiftBot Tunnel Vision (Java Robotics Project)
Overview

This project was developed as part of a university robotics programming assignment using the SwiftBot API.

The objective was to design and implement an autonomous tunnel detection system capable of:

Detecting tunnel entry and exit using light intensity analysis

Measuring tunnel length and gap distances

Detecting obstacles using ultrasound sensors

Capturing grayscale images

Logging execution data to file

Key Features
